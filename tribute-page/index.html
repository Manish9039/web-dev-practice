          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <p>
            Edward Newgate, better known as Whitebeard, was one of the most
            legendary pirates in the world of One Piece. He was the captain of
            the Whitebeard Pirates and was feared for his unmatched strength,
            earning him the title of "The Strongest Man in the World." Despite
            his terrifying power, Whitebeard was also known for his compassion,
            loyalty, and the fatherly bond he shared with his crew. His legacy
            continues to inspire generations of pirates in the New World.
          </p>

          <h2>Early Life</h2>
          <p>
            Born in Sphinx Island, Edward Newgate grew up in poverty. Despite
            having little, he always cared deeply for those around him. He was
            not interested in treasure but sought something far more
            valuable—family. His dream was to create a place where everyone
            could belong, leading him to build one of the most powerful pirate
            crews ever assembled.
          </p>

          <h2>The Whitebeard Pirates</h2>
          <p>
            Whitebeard’s crew was known not just for their strength but for
            their unity and loyalty. Every member was considered part of
            Whitebeard’s family, and he would go to any length to protect them.
            He believed no treasure was more precious than the bond of his crew.
            His signature words: "A man does not need a reason to protect his
            own children."
          </p>

          <h2>Power and Abilities</h2>
          <p>
            Whitebeard wielded the power of the Gura Gura no Mi, a
            Paramecia-type Devil Fruit that allowed him to create powerful
            earthquakes capable of destroying entire islands. His immense
            physical strength and mastery of Haki made him one of the most
            feared pirates in history. He could split the sea and even crack the
            sky with a single punch.
          </p>

          <h2>Whitebeard’s Legacy and the Summit War</h2>
          <p>
            Whitebeard’s most famous moment came during the Paramount War at
            Marineford, where he fought to rescue his adopted son, Portgas D.
            Ace. Despite facing overwhelming odds and being betrayed, Whitebeard
            stood tall until the very end. His final words proclaimed the
            existence of the One Piece, reigniting the Great Pirate Era. Even in
            death, he left a profound impact, symbolizing strength, family, and
            unbreakable will.<br />"One Piece… it’s real!"
          </p>

          <h2>Memorable Quotes</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              "No matter who you are, you are not free to talk about the
              future!"
            </li>
            <li>
              "The world may ridicule me as a fool, but it is better to be a
              fool who believes in his friends!"
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Conclusion</h2>
          <p>
            Whitebeard’s story is one of strength, loyalty, and the pursuit of a
            dream. He lived as a giant among men, unshaken by the forces of the
            world, and left behind a legacy that continues to shape the seas of
            the New World.
